# How it works
The code takes in the user's name. Then, the code asks the user to enter any string and it returns the number of characters used in that string to the user while ignoring spaces and null characters. The code then prints the "Hi," plus the name from the input along with the number of characters in the string that was given through the input field. It gets the number of characters by looping through the string and adding one to a counter varible for each character that is not a space. The second part of the code asks the user to type in any string. The input has to be a string or the loop will break. Once they enter a string, the program will count the number of char's in the input "word" and increment the count variable for the number of chars. Once the word has been read all the way through, the program outputs a sentence describing that the user had a string with x amount of chars. 

# How to use it
Users will answer prompted commands and enter the correct input
For example these lines of the code:
`print("Hello!)`
`name=input("Please enter your name"`
`print("Hi, " + name)`
will ask the user for their name so the user will then type their name and see an output containing "Hi, " plus their name.
