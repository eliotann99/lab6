# How it works


The code takes in the user's name. Then, the code asks the user to enter any string and it returns the number of characters used in that string to the user while ignoring spaces and null characters. The code then prints the "Hi," plus the name from the input along with the number of characters in the string that was given through the input field. It gets the number of characters by looping through the string and adding one to a counter varible for each character that is not a space.
